Finally the lightwalletd server is totally synced, and I still got connection refused, I'm 
super worried about that if the infra chain of zcash is totally broken, some of their code 
are well designed, but they are always facing the problem out-of-maintained in the past years.

Okay, it is just caused by a config of my lightwalletd, finally, things work now!

I hope, I can complete the following tasks today: 1. verify our frost solution can send fund.
2. test coverage for all instructions of the solana program. 3. pack the solana light client
and our zcash light client into zyhpers.

Spent lots of time on downgrade & upgrade zcash deps, the tech is more complicated than I 
expected, but pretty interesting, I'd fix all version mistach issues for zcash if I can get 
a grant, however I saw zcash people already working on these but the PRs are not merged yet, 
they likely missing human resources to maintain the codebase.

The node is still syncing, tried to connect with the lightwalletd server, connection
refused, from the docs of zebrad, it says, we need to wait the lightwalletd server to
be totally synced, let's just wait.

Just started working on the solana program, the version matching issue of solana toolchains
is awful, I don't understand, anchor is now part of solana foundation, and it still can not
match the latest solana sdk version, for the anaz team, they are now building pinocchio?
each of the teams want to get rid of other teams, hmm, decentralized.

The old friend solana-program-test is duplicated, now I'd like to choose mollusk-svm, don't
understand how they figure out this name, but I'm choosing it because it supports benchmark
and maintained by the anza team, even still have version matching issues with anchor, fuck it.

The consensus program on solana is pretty simple, while testing it is still pain, anchor and
mollusk, they are not compatible, I have to copy the binary from `target/deploy` to
`tests/fixtures` again and again? it's been so many years and anchor still doesn't have their
own test framework, such auto vm loading feature works in each of my side projects. don't
understand how can solana developers stand it, this such thing should not block great teams
building their product, likely this can be a reason that explains why I'm still poor now,
I've spent too much time on building wheels, making things better, but not building products
focused on users, the story is different.

Refactored the frost system to use the correct curve redpallas. it's super tricky to get
the viewing key of the key package, using a random spending key? I don't think this is
correct, or if it is just for nullifier and randomness? after checking the source code of
generating the viewing key from original spending key, I see the spending key is used as
authority key, nullifier and randomness, so likely we need to pin the random bytes we are
using to sth, for example, derive it from our verifying key directly.

I have tested that the generated orchard address and the unified address are valid with
zcash testnet, after sending a private transaction via zashi to the unified address, I
can decrypt it with the viewing key.

To verify this solution totally, I need to make a transaction with the key package, to
see if it works as what I expected.

Wrap a transaction is pretty complicated as well, I can not use the exist transaction
builder with frost, fuck it, I need to assemble the orchard bundle on my own, it requires
the on-chain merkle tree data, looks like it could be generated by the rust-client-backend
conveniently.

Okay, to make the rust-light-client work, I need to run a lightwalletd server, and to make
the lightwalletd server work, I need to run a zcash node, idk who designed this.

Tried to search if there are exists provider, none of them is suitable for me, tried the
public nodes, seems they are just for node sync usages, okay, I have run my own node again
now.

Refactor the arch of my bridge, I'm feeling bored today indeed, my time spent is not efficient
enough, feeling confused if I can get we I want during the zypherpunk hackthon, If I'm on the 
tright track, I have sinked into the docs and the concepts of zcash, I have no memory about
what I'm doing day by day, fuck it, I hate this feeling.

Got the holy grail, frost! developed by zcash, there is demo but lots of confusing stuffs,
I can start integrating it into my implementation anyway.

The key package is easy to use, however idk how to generate the viewing key of it, they
frost repo, the orchard library and the zcash_keys are not fully compatible, especially
different concepts in frost and orchard.

Using a custody wallet for the zcash side bridge is meaningless, even for a POC, if the POC
doesn't show how I solving the main problem of bridge, what makes it a POC, a PPT?

zcash supports multi-sig wallet, but for the transparent address, hmm, the hackthon wants to
see privacy bridge, if it is even possible?

but even with multi-sig wallet, I can try to make my bridge as decentralized as possible, I
can even build a chain struct network for it.

Yesterday is my birthday, nobody remembers it but myself, I want a good business which is 
missed in my life for so many years, I have to get noticied this time, even though there
is no perfect bridge solution, there are still bridges running in the world right now,
things ship, time doesn't wait.

The concept of zcash is pretty complicated, and the infra is bad, this is why we are building
here now, really a lot of spaces, but the main thing is to get the makert fit, not stuck in
building low-level stuffs which won't work tbh, however building such thing like the bridge
is what I good at, simple UI, heavy compact work in the node, I can do it better than anyone 
else in the world.

Anyway, need to learn the keys of zcash first.

Nov 15

Doing research, I don't believe there is perfect solution for bridge in the world.

I can start build anyway, init the project, I need to catch up this chance anyway, 
shine on you crazy diamond.
